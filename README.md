HealthHub: Your All-in-One Digital Health Companion 

Hey there! Welcome to HealthHub - the health platform I've been working on that brings everything you need for your wellness journey into one convenient app. Think of it as having a doctor's office, pharmacy, and health assistant right in your pocket!

Let Me Show You Around

The Main Dashboard

This is where you land when you open HealthHub. I designed it to give you quick access to everything:

That "AI Disease Detection" button? That's my favorite part - you can upload medical images and get instant analysis

Need to talk to a doctor? The telemedicine section connects you right away

Browse doctors by specialty (like Dr. Karen here - she's a top gynecologist)

See their qualifications upfront

Pick dates and times that actually work for you

Get confirmed instantly, no waiting

Pharmacy at Your Fingertips

Everything you'd find at your local pharmacy, but delivered:

Delivery right to your door

I've made buying medicines as easy as online shopping. You get:

Clear product info (like this CoQ10 supplement - great for heart health!)

<img width="1917" height="913" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-02 225124" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76910782-5501-43ee-a8e8-d67c49e32ac9" />

Tired of lost medical reports? Everything gets securely stored here.

Lab Tests Without the Wait

Remember waiting hours at diagnostic centers? Now you can:

Book tests from home

Choose from all the common tests (diabetes, thyroid, etc.)

Get results delivered to the app

No more sitting in crowded waiting rooms!

A Quick Note
HealthHub isn't meant to replace emergency care or your regular doctor visits. It's here to make everything else easier so you can focus on getting and staying healthy.

Thanks for checking out HealthHub! Whether you're a potential user, fellow developer, or just curious about health tech - I appreciate you taking the time to look through what we're building.
